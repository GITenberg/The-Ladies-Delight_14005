<p>
<i>Gentlemen</i>,

<div style="width: 20%; float: left; margin-right: 1em;">
<a href="images/delight2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/delight2.png"

</div>
<p style="text-indent: -1em;">S Nature hath been so <i>very Indulgent</i> to ye, as to stock your Gardens
with <i>Trees</i> of the <i>largest Growth</i>, for which Reason ye are caress'd,
whilst Men of <i>less Parts</i>, tho' in <i>some Things</i> more deserving, are
laugh'd at, and excluded all Company.
</p>
<p>
As all Infants, especially of the Female Sex, are much delighted with
Fruit, so as their Years and other Appetites increase, no Wonder if that
increases too. Both Men and Beasts have <i>some-thing</i> or another, for
which they are esteem'd; so ye being in a particular manner Happy in
this <i>Talent</i>, may securely laugh, while ye daily <i>grow</i> in the Ladies
Favour, and spread your <i>Branches</i> over all the Kingdom: Many a hopeful
<i>Stick of Wood</i> has been produc'd by this glorious Tree, who after they
had <i>piss'd</i> their Estates against the Wall (as the good Housewives term
it) have by the Strength of true <i>Hibernian</i> Prowess rais'd themselves
to the Favour of some fair Virtuoso, and being by her <i>plac'd in a
HOT-BED</i>, have been restor'd to their pristine Strength, and flourish'd
again; and like true Heroes, not envying the busy World, have been
content to <i>spend</i> the remainder of their Days in an obscure Nook of the
World.
</p>
<p>
Thus, Gentlemen, and as all Poets chuse the most Worthy to patronize
their Works, I humbly offer ye the following Poem, and that you may
still continue as ye now are; that your Trees may ever flourish, your
<i>Green-houses</i> be secure, nor your <i>young Plants</i> be ever nipt in the
<i>Bud</i>, and that you may ever <i>stand</i> against all <i>Cracks</i>, Storms,
Tempests, and <i>Eruptions</i>,
</p>
<center>
<i>Is the hearty Wishes of Your's</i>,

           <p>  THE Tree of which I fain would sing,</p>
           <p>  If the kind Muse her Aid would bring,</p>
           <p>  Is <i>Arbor Vitæ</i>; but in brief,</p>
           <p>  By vulgar Men call'd&mdash;<i>Tree of Life</i>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
           <p>  First for Description then, 'tis such</p>
           <p>  As needs must captivate you much.</p>
           <p>  In Stem most streight, of lovely Size,</p>
           <p>  With Head elate this Plant doth rise;</p>
           <p>  First bare&mdash;when it doth further shoot,</p>
           <p>  <i>A Tuft of Moss</i> keeps warm the Root:</p>
           <p>  No <i>Lapland</i> Muff has such a Fur,</p>
           <p>  No Skin so soft has any Cur;</p>
           <p>  This touch'd, alone the Heart can move,</p>
           <p>  Which Ladies more than Lap-dogs love;</p>
           <p>  From this erect springs up the Stalk,</p>
           <p>  No Power can stop, or ought can baulk;</p>
           <p>  On Top an <i>Apex</i> crowns the Tree,</p>
           <p>  As all Mankind may plainly see;</p>
           <p>  So shines a Filbeard, when the Shell,</p>
           <p>  Half gone, displays the <i>ruby Peel</i></p>
           <p>  Or like a Cherry bright and gay,</p>
           <p>  Just red'ning in the Month of <i>May</i>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
           <p>  As other Trees bear Fruit at Top,</p>
           <p>  And they who rob 'em must <i>climb up</i>;</p>
           <p>  This still more rare doth upward shoot,</p>
           <p>  But at the Bottom bears its Fruit,</p>
           <p>  And they who'd reap its Virtues strong,</p>
           <p>  Need but to lay 'em <i>all along</i>,</p>
           <p>  <i>Ope' wide, their Mouths</i>, and they'll receive</p>
           <p>  The <i>Fruit of Life</i>, and eat, and live:</p>
           <p>  Not the fair Tree that <i>India</i> bears,</p>
           <p>  All over Spice both Head and Ears,</p>
           <p>  Can boast more Gifts than the Great Pow'rs</p>
           <p>  Have granted to this Tree of ours:</p>
           <p>  That in good Ale its Power boasts,</p>
           <p>  And ours has <i>Nutmeg's</i> fit for <i>Toasts</i></p>
           <p>  And Bags by <i>Nature</i> planted grow,</p>
           <p>  To keep 'em from all Winds that blow.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
           <p>  The Rise is slow, and by Degrees,</p>
           <p>  Both Fruits and Tree itself increase</p>
           <p>  So slow, that ten Years scarce produce</p>
           <p>  <i>Six Inches</i> good and fit for Use;</p>
           <p>  But fifteen ripen well the Fruit,</p>
           <p>  And add a <i>viscous Balm</i> into't;</p>
           <p>  Then rub'd, drops Tears as if 'twas greiv'd,</p>
           <p>  Which by a neighbouring Shrub's receiv'd;</p>
           <p>  As Men set Tubs to catch the Rain,</p>
           <p>  So does this Shrub <i>its Juice</i> retain,</p>
           <p>  Which 'cause it wears a colour'd Robe,</p>
           <p>  Is justly call'd the <i>flow'ring Shrub</i>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
           <p>  In every Nation springs this Tree,</p>
           <p>  In some confin'd; in others more free;</p>
           <p>  In <i>England</i>, 'tis of mod'rate Size,</p>
           <p>  And oft' does <i>nine full inches</i> rise:</p>
           <p>  But <i>Ireland</i>, tho' in Soil most poor,</p>
           <p>  Exceeds all Lands in this fame Store;</p>
           <p>  And sent o'er hither, it is such</p>
           <p>  As does exceed our own by much,</p>
           <p>  And gets the Owner many a <i>Farthing</i>,</p>
           <p>  For <i>Ladies</i> love it in their <i>Garden</i>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
           <p>  That it's a <i>Tree</i> right <i>sensitive</i>,</p>
           <p>  Denies no honest Man alive:</p>
           <p>  Tho' as one <i>shrinks</i> and will not stand,</p>
           <p>  This <i>rises</i> at a <i>Lady's</i> Hand,</p>
           <p>  And grows more strong the more 'tis strok'd,</p>
           <p>  As others <i>fall</i> when they are <i>pok'd</i>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
           <p>  When nipping Cold bites off our Nose,</p>
           <p>  And hoary Frosts the Morn disclose,</p>
           <p>  In <i>Hot-beds</i> only then 'twill live,</p>
           <p>  And only when-well warm'd will thrive;</p>
           <p>  But when warm Summer does appear,</p>
           <p>  'Twill <i>stand</i> all <i>brunts</i> in open Air;</p>
           <p>  Tho' oft they're overcome with Heat,</p>
           <p>  And sink with Nurture too replete;</p>
           <p>  Then <i>Birchen Twigs</i>, if right apply'd</p>
           <p>  To Back, Fore-part, or either Side&mdash;&mdash;</p>
           <p>  Support a while, <i>and keep it up</i>,</p>
           <p>  Tho' soon again the Plant will droop.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
           <p>  <i>Motteux</i> had one very untow'rd,</p>
           <p>  And thought to mend it with a Cord,</p>
           <p>  But <i>kill'd the Tree</i>, yet gain'd his <i>End</i>,</p>
           <p>  Which makes th' Experiment condemn'd.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
           <p>  Others have thought to mend the Root,</p>
           <p>  By taking from the Tree its Fruit;</p>
           <p>  But in the <i>Nutmegs</i> lies the Breed,</p>
           <p>  And when they're gone we lose the <i>Seed</i>;</p>
           <p>  Tho' Virtuosi still have don't,</p>
           <p>  And always found it yield Accompt;</p>
           <p>  For <i>Hey&mdash;&mdash;gg&mdash;&mdash;r</i> then buys the <i>Wood</i>,</p>
           <p>  And of it makes us Whistles good,</p>
           <p>  Which yearly from <i>Italia</i> sent,</p>
           <p>  Here answers his and our Intent.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">

           <p>  <i>Ulate</i> their Plants on <i>Medlars</i> Stock,</p>
           <p>  (<i>i.e.</i> as Tongues in Vulgar pass,</p>
           <p>  They graft it on an <i>Open-arse</i>;)</p>
           <p>  But Gardeners, Virtuosi, all,</p>
           <p>  Say this is most <i>unnatural</i>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
           <p>  That Soil is certainly the best,</p>
           <p>  Whence first it sprang, and first increast,</p>
           <p>  In Vallies hollow, soft, and warm,</p>
           <p>  With Hills to ward off every Storm,</p>
           <p>  Where Water salt runs trickling down,</p>
           <p>  And <i>Tendrils</i> lie o'er all the Ground,</p>
           <p>  Such as the Tree itself shoots forth,</p>
           <p>  And better if't be tow'rds the <i>North</i>;</p>
           <p>  When such a Piece of Ground you see,</p>

           <p>  There plant it deep unto the <i>Root</i>,</p>
           <p>  And never fear&mdash;&mdash;you'll soon have <i>Fruit</i>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
           <p>  Tho' let young <i>Botanists</i> beware</p>
           <p>  Of Insects that oft' harbour there,</p>

           <p>  And if not kill'd, eat up the <i>Seed</i>:</p>
           <p>  Good <i>Humphrey Bowen</i> gives another,</p>

           <p>  That is, to take especial Care</p>
           <p>  Not to set <i>Vulvaria</i> near;</p>
           <p>  Of them two Sorts are frequent found,</p>
           <p>  One helps, and to'ther spoils the Ground;</p>
           <p>  And many a Plant thriving and tall,</p>
           <p>  Destroy'd by them, has got a Fall.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div>
<p style="text-indent: -1em;">HE <i>Tree of Life</i> is a <i>succulent Plant</i>, consisting of one only strait
stem, on the top of which is a <i>Pistillum</i> or <i>Apex</i>, at some times
<i>Glandiform</i> and resembling a <i>May-Cherry</i>, tho' at others, more like
the <i>Nut</i> of the <i>Avellana</i> or <i>Filbeard-Tree</i>.
</p>
<p>
Its fruits, contrary to most others, grow near the Root; they are
usually no more than two in number, their bigness somewhat exceeding
that of an ordinary <i>Nutmeg</i> both contained in one strong <i>Siliqua</i>, or
purse; which, together with the whole root of the plant, is commonly
thick set with numerous <i>Fibrilla</i> or <i>capillary Tendrils</i>.
</p>
<p>
The tree is of slow growth, and requires time to bring it to perfection,
rarely seeding to any purpose before the fifteenth year; when the fruits
coming to good maturity, yield a viscous Juice or balmy <i>succus</i>, which
being from time to time discharged at the <i>Pistillum</i> is mostly bestow'd
upon the open <i>Calyx's</i> of the <i>Frutex Vulvaria</i> or <i>flow'ring Shrub</i>
usually spreading under the shade of this tree, and whose parts are by a
wonderful mechanism adapted to receive it. The ingenious Mr. <i>Richard
Bradley</i> is of opinion, the <i>Frutex</i> is hereby impregnated, and then
first begins to bear; he therefore accounts this <i>Succus</i> the <i>Farina
foecundans</i> of the plant: and the learned <i>Leonhard Fucksius</i>, in his
<i>Historia Stirpium insigniorum</i>, observes the greatest sympathy between
this tree and shrub, <i>They are</i>, says he, <i>of the same genus, and do
best in the same bed, the</i> Vulvaria <i>itself being indeed no other than
a</i> female Arbor Vitæ.
</p>
<p>
It is produced in most Countries, tho' it thrives more in some than
others, where it also increases to a larger size. The height here in
<i>England</i> rarely passes nine, or at the most, eleven inches, and that
chiefly in <i>Kent</i>, whereas in <i>Ireland</i>, it comes to far greater
dimensions, is so good, that many of the natives entirely subsist upon
it, and when transplanted, have been sometimes known to raise good
houses with single plants of this sort.
</p>
<p>
As the <i>Irish</i> soil is accounted the best, others are as remarkably bad
for its cultivation; and the least and worst in the world are said to be
about <i>Harborough</i> and the <i>Forest of Sherard</i>.
</p>
<p>
The stem seems to be of the <i>sensitive</i> tribe, tho' herein differing
from the more common <i>Sensitives</i>; that whereas they are known to shrink
and retire from even the gentlest touch of a Lady's hand, this rises on
the contrary, and extends itself when it is so handled.
</p>
<p>
In winter it is not easy to raise these trees without a hot bed; but in
warmer weather they stand well in the open air.
</p>
<p>
In the latter season they are subject to become weak and flaccid,
and want support; for which purpose some gardeners have thought of
splintering them up with <i>birchen Twigs</i>, which has seem'd of some
service for the present, tho' the plants have very soon come to the
same or a more drooping state than before.
</p>
<p>
The late ingenious Mr. <i>Motteux</i> thought of restoring a fine plant he
had in this condition, by tying it up with a <i>Tomex</i> or cord made of the
bark of the <i>Vitex</i>, or <i>Hempen-Tree</i>: but whether he made the ligature
too straight, or that the nature of the <i>Vitex</i> is really in itself
pernicious, he quite kill'd his plant thereby; which makes this
universally condemn'd, as a dangerous experiment.
</p>
<p>
Some <i>Virtuosi</i> have thought of improving their trees for some purposes,
by taking off the <i>Nutmegs</i>, which is however a bad way; they never
<i>seed</i> after, and are good for little more than making whistles of,
which are imported every year from <i>Italy</i>, and sell indeed at a good
price.
</p>
<p>
Some other curious Gentlemen have endeavour'd to inoculate their plants
on the stock of the <i>Medlar</i> and that with a manure of <i>human Ordure</i>,
but this has never been approv'd; and I have known some tree brought to
a <i>very ill end</i> by such management.
</p>
<p>
The natural soil is certainly the best for their propagation; and that
is in hollow places, that are warm and near salt water, best known by
their producing the same sort of <i>Tendrils</i> as are observ'd about the
roots of the <i>Arbor</i> itself. Some cautions however are very necessary,
especially to young <i>Botanists</i>; and first, to be very diligent in
keeping their trees clean and neat; a pernicious sort of insect, not,
unlike a <i>Morpione</i> or <i>Cimex</i>, being very subject to breed amongst the
<i>Fibrillæ</i>, which, if not taken heed of, and timely destroy'd, proves
often of very dangerous consequence.
</p>
<p>
Another caution, no less useful, we have from that excellent and
judicious Botanist Mr. <i>Humphrey Bowen</i>, to beware of a poisonous
species of <i>Vulvaria</i>, too often mistaken for the wholesome one, and
which, if suffer'd too near our trees, will very greatly endanger their
well-being. He tells us, in the 12th volume of his large abridgment of
<i>la Quintinye</i>, that before he had acquir'd his judgment and experience,
some of his plants have often been sufferers through this mistake; and
he has seen a tall thriving tree, by the contact: only of this venomous
shrub, become <i>porrose, scabiose</i>, and cover'd with <i>fungous
Excrescences</i> not unlike the fruits of the <i>Ficus sylvestris</i> in which
case the <i>succus</i> also has lost both its colour and vertue; and the tree
itself has so much partaken of the nature of the venomous shrub that had
hurt it, that itself has become venomous, and spread the poison through
a whole Plantation.
</p>
<p>
These distempers of a tree of the greatest use and value, have employ'd
the labours of the most eminent Botanists and Gardeners, to seek out
remedies for them: In which, however, none have succeeded like the
celebrated <i>Dr. Misaubin</i> who from his profound knowledge in Botany has
composed a most elaborate work upon <i>all the things that can happen</i>,
both to the <i>Arbor Vitæ</i> and <i>Vulvaria also</i>: There he has taught a
certain cure for all these evils; and, what is most wonderful, has even
found out a way of making the most venomous <i>Vulvaria</i> itself wholesome,
which he practises daily, to the satisfaction of all that apply to him.
</p>
<p>
These venomous <i>Vulvaria</i> are but too common in most gardens about
<i>London</i>; there are many in St. <i>James's Park</i>, and more in the
celebrated gardens at <i>Vaux-hall</i> over the water.
</p>
<h3>
<i>The</i> NAMES <i>and</i> VIRTUES.
</h3>
<p>
Besides the common name of <i>Arbor Vitæ</i>, a very learned Philosopher
and great Divine would have it call'd, <i>Arbor Scientiæ boni &amp; mali</i>;
believing, upon very good grounds, this is the tree which grew in the
middle of the garden of <i>Eden</i>, and whose fruits were so alluring to
our first mother. Others would have it call'd the <i>Mandrake</i> of <i>Leah</i>,
persuaded it is the same whose juice made the before barren <i>Rachel</i>
a joyful mother of children.
</p>
<p>
The learned <i>Madame D'Acier</i> in her notes upon <i>Homer</i> contends it
should be called <i>Nepenthes</i>. She gives many reasons why it certainly
is that very plant, whose fruits the <i>Egyptian</i> queen recommended to
<i>Helen</i>, as a certain cure for pain and grief of all sorts, and which
She ever after kept by her as her most precious jewel, and made use of
as a <i>Panacæa</i> upon all occasions.
</p>
<p>
The great Dr. <i>Bentley</i> calls it more than once <i>Machæra Herculis</i>,
having proved out of the fragments of a <i>Greek</i> Poet, that of this tree
was made that club with which the hero is said to have overcome the
fifty wild daughters of <i>Thespius</i>, but which Queen <i>Omphale</i> afterwards
reduced to a distaff. Others have thought the celebrated <i>Hesperian</i>
trees were of this sort; and the very name of <i>Poma Veneris</i>, frequently
given by Authors to the fruits of this tree, is a sufficient proof these
were really the <i>Apples</i> for which three Goddesses contended in so warm
a manner, and to which the Queen of beauty had undoubtedly the strongest
title.
</p>
<p>
The vertues are so many, a large volume might be wrote of them. The
juice taken inwardly cures the green-sickness and other infirmities of
the like sort, and is a true specific in most disorders of the fair sex.
It indeed often causes tumours in the umbilical region; but even those
being really of no ill consequence, disperse of themselves in a few
Months.
</p>
<p>
It chears the heart, and exhilarates the mind, quiets jars, feuds and
discontents, making the most churlish tempers surprizingly kind and
loving. Nor have private persons only been the better for this
reconciling vertue, but whole states and kingdoms, nay, the greatest
empires in the world have often received the benefit of it; the most
destructive wars have been ended, and the most friendly treaties been
produced, by a right application of this universal medicine among the
chief of the contending parties.
</p>
<p>
If any person is desirous to see this excellent and wonderful plant in
good perfection, he may meet with it at the aforementioned Mr <i>Bowen's</i>
garden at <i>Lambeth</i>, who calls it <i>The Silver-Spoon Tree</i>; and is at all
times ready to oblige his friends with the sight of it.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
